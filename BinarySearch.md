# Basic Binary Search Problems

1. **Binary Search Function**  
   Write a function to implement binary search on a sorted array.

2. **Finding the First Occurrence**  
   Implement a function to find the first occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.

3. **Finding the Last Occurrence**  
   Write a function to find the last occurrence of a target element in a sorted array.

4. **Count Occurrences**  
   Create a function that counts the number of occurrences of a target element in a sorted array.

5. **Search Insert Position**  
   Implement a function that returns the index where a target should be inserted in a sorted array to maintain order.

6. **Check if Array is Sorted**  
   Write a function to check if a given array is sorted in ascending order.

7. **Finding Square Root Using Binary Search**  
   Implement a function that finds the integer part of the square root of a non-negative number using binary search.

8. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**  
   Write a function to find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.

9. **Peak Element**  
   Create a function that finds a peak element in an array (an element that is greater than or equal to its neighbors).

10. **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**  
    Implement a function to search for a target value in a rotated sorted array.
